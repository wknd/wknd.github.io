title: "Permission from Angelique Shelley to use her work"
---

I got in contact with Angelique Shelley about using her work for [one of my posts]({% post_url /ctf/2019-01-03-35c3-junior-ctf-writeups-part-2 %}) on {{ site.title }} and she gave me her explicit permission.
I had put the license as Creative Commons while asking, which of course wasn't correct. I should probably add a generic "all rights reserved" license to the license database.

Her email response was the following:

> Hi Weekend,  
> Thanks for choosing my artwork for your blog, The license certainly isn't creative commons, I retain the copyright, but I give you permission to use it in this instance.  
> Thanks again and have a great week!  Angelique

This means that while I have permission to use her work, this doesn't mean anyone else can without explicit permission.

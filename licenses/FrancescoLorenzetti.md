title: "Permission from Francesco Lorenzetti to use his work"
---

I got in contact with Francesco Lorenzetti about using his work as a [background image](https://secur.ity-pro.be/assets/images-original/global/cross-street_francesco.lorenzetti.jpg) on {{ site.title }} and he gave me his explicit permission.
His email response was the following:

>   Hi weekend,  
>   since you are doing an open source project you have the right to use the image! enjoy  
>   :) 

This means I am permitted to use this image, and potentially other projects are also permitted to use it as long as they are opensource. Though it may require permission on a case by case basis. To be safe, contact him on his [Artstation page](https://www.artstation.com/frank_lorenzetti) if you also wish to use this image.
